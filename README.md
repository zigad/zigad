👋 Hi there! I'm Žiga (@zigad), a tech-loving, gadget-enthusiast with a passion for innovation and the latest trends in the tech world. As a developer by profession, I spend my days coding away, but my true excitement lies in exploring the possibilities beyond the conventional.

👀 I'm deeply interested in the fascinating realm of Exploits, Research, Pentesting, and Hacking. However, my focus extends beyond just digital systems—I love applying my skills to everyday objects, seeking to understand and uncover their potential vulnerabilities. My primary goal in this hobby is to utilize this knowledge for educational purposes, empowering others to learn and grow in a safe environment.

🌱 Currently, I'm in a continuous learning journey, always expanding my knowledge and skill set. I have upcoming projects in the exciting field of Ham Radio, as well as everyday "hacking" explorations. I believe that combining diverse interests leads to remarkable discoveries.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate on interesting projects that not only challenge me but also have a real impact on improving lives or pushing the boundaries of technology. If you have any intriguing ideas or ongoing projects, I'd love to contribute my expertise and speed up the progress together.

📫 Want to get in touch? Feel free to reach out to me, and let's start a conversation. Whether it's sharing insights, discussing potential collaborations, or simply connecting on a personal level, I'm open to it all. Together, we can make a difference and embark on an exciting journey!
